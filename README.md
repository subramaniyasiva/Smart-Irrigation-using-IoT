# Smart-Irrigation-using-IoT
#"Excited to share my Smart Irrigation IoT project ðŸŒ±ðŸš€! It includes a soil moisture sensor, two water pump relays, and a water level sensor. 
The pumps turn on based on the moisture value
and the system fetches water from the large repository when needed. #IoT #SmartIrrigation #Automation"
